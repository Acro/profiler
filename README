How to compile demo.c example:

	Compiling for full-tracing can be done with:

		. run source_file

	If you want to trace specific function, use:

		. run source_file function_name

To run program that will generate output file (out.txt) use:

	./main

Tracing output is located at:

	out.txt

Analyzing data:
	
	First of all, you need to compile evaluate.c using:
		
		gcc -o evaluate evaluate.c

	To analyze output file you can use following command:

		./evaluate out.txt

	This will print runtime of each function onto stdout.
        The first parameter is the output file you want to analyze.

Printing histogram for specific function
	
	Requires gnuplot.

	To print a hostigram into a PNG file you first need to compile ev_graph.c file using:
		
		gcc -o graph ev_graph.c

	Usage:

		. data2graph tracing_output text_output image_output

		Example: 
			
			. data2graph out.txt temp.txt out.png
		
		tracing_output is the output file from ./main
	
		text_output is any file where temporary data will be stored 

		image_output has to be png (!) file, will be generated using temporary data
