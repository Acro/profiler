How to compile demo.c example:

	Compiling for full-tracing can be done with:

		. run.sh

	If you want to trace specific function, use:

		. run.sh functionName

To run program that will generate output file (out.txt) use:

	./main

Tracing output is located at:

	out.txt

Analyzing data:
	
	First of all, you need to compile evaluate.c using:
		
		gcc -o evaluate evaluate.c

	To analyze output file you can use following command:

		./evaluate out.txt

	This will print runtime of each function onto stdout.
        The first parameter is executable file you want to analyze.
